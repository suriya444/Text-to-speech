# Text-to-Speech 

This project is a simple implementation of a Text-to-Speech application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter text, select a voice, and have the text spoken out loud by the browser.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout of the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the text-to-speech functionality.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Enter the text you want to convert to speech in the provided textarea.

4. Select a voice from the dropdown menu.

5. Click the "Speak" button to hear the text spoken out loud.

## Customization

You can customize the project by modifying the following aspects:

- Styling: Adjust the styles in the `style.css` file to change the appearance of the web page.

- Voice Options: Update the voice options by modifying the data in the `voices` array in the `script.js` file.

- Additional Functionality: Extend the project by adding features such as pause/resume, volume control, or language selection.

## Compatibility

The project uses the Web Speech API for text-to-speech functionality, which is supported by most modern web browsers. However, it's recommended to test the project in different browsers to ensure compatibility.
